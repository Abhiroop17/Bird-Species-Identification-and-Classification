Project Overview

Bird species identification is a challenging task due to the vast variety of species and the subtle differences in appearance. This project addresses the challenge by implementing a CNN model that learns from visual features to classify images into specific bird species categories.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images for over 20 bird species, organized into training, validation, and test sets:

Training Set: Contains labeled images for training the model.
Validation Set: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Test Set: For evaluating final model performance.
Each bird species has its own folder, with images named and organized to enable categorical classification.

Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with the following architecture:

Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction, with increasing filters at each layer.
MaxPooling Layers: Reduces spatial dimensions, retaining important features.
Fully Connected Layers: With Dropout to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer: Softmax layer for multi-class classification.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-species-identification.git

cd bird-species-identification

Install the required packages:

pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy seaborn

Prepare the dataset by unzipping it into the project directory:

unzip path_to_dataset.zip -d birds

Usage
Training the Model: Run the following code to train the CNN:

python

python train_model.py

Prediction: Use the predict_bird_species function in the predict.py file to classify a new image:

python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg

Evaluate Model: To test the model on the validation set and view accuracy metrics, use:

python evaluate_model.py

Results
After training, the model achieved the following performance:

Accuracy: XX%
Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Evaluated across each species
Confusion Matrix: Visualized to show the prediction distribution per species
The model shows promising accuracy in distinguishing between visually similar species, with room for improvement in handling rare species.

Future Improvements

Data Augmentation: Experiment with additional augmentations to improve generalization.

Model Tuning: Explore deeper architectures or fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet).

Hyperparameter Optimization: Perform hyperparameter tuning for further performance gains.
